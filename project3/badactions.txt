You miss your bus
you are hit by car
you fail chemistry 
you drop your phone and it cracks 
your computer crashes
you fall into lava in Mincraft
you fall into a hole
Your headphones are dead during lunch
You wave at someone who is not waving at you
They hit you with the "You are like a friend to me"
The buffet is out of your favorite thing 
you can not find parking at Tennessee Tech 
you get off on the wrong exit 
You walk into a glass door
Taco Bell gives you the runs
your car dash lights up like a christmas tree
You wake up to realize your phone didn't charge last night
You can only play League of Legends from now on
Your car makes expensive noise 
You waited in line for an hour just to realize you were in the wrong line
